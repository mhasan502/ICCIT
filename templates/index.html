                International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT) actually started its journey in
                the year 1998. ICCIT has evolved from the National Conference on Computer and Information Systems
                (NCClS) which was held in 1997 at the Dhaka University, Bangladesh. Since 1998, the conference is being
                organized every year by different public and private universities. This is the longest running IEEE
                sponsored peer-reviewed conference in Bangladesh.
