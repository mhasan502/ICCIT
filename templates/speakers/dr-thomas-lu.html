                    An Explainable AI Assistant for First Responder Driver Safety

                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Fatalities caused by emergency responder vehicle collisions in the United States are 4.8 times higher than the national average. In this keynote
                    presentation, an AI Assistant - Trusted and exPlainable Artificial Intelligence for Saving Lives (TruePAL) is presented. The TruePAL project was
                    created as a result of U.S. Congressional Appropriations to study the technologies for saving first responders and roadside crews lives in and around
                    active traffic. TruePAL provides real-time warning of risks that can be understood by a human driver. TruePAL analyzes data from multiple sources,
                    performs reasoning and inferences, and provides the driver real-time prioritized action recommendations. TruePAL is capable of learning traffic
                    history, analyzing the environment, using AI reasoning and applying traffic rules to generate timely warning to the drivers and roadside crews to
                    avoid crashes. The TruePAL system has successfully demonstrated its capability of generating timely warning in over a dozen simulated traffic
                    scenarios in busy intersections and roadsides. The preliminary test results have shown that TruePAL provides the drivers and crew members precious 3-7
                    seconds advanced warnings before a crash occurs.
